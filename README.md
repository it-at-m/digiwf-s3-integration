<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

There are several ways to store files in S3 compatible storage. Each project often has to implement the same
functionalities and solve the same problems. With this library, we create the possibility to store and clean up files to 
in a structured and simple way. Here's why:

* Files often need to be stored in folder structures
* Files often must be stored in a structured way and enriched with metadata
* Cleaning up the data must be done in a structured way
* Synchronous and asynchronous interfaces are often required

Of course, one service is not suitable for all projects, as your needs may be different. That's why we decided to
provide a Spring Boot Starter library for an integration service that can be easily customized. 
Additionally a second starter library is included, which serves as a client library to handle files and folders
with the above-mentioned starter.

### Built With

This project is built with:

* [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
* [minio](https://min.io)
* [Hibernate](https://hibernate.org)

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting the integration library

_Below is an example of how you can install and setup your service_

1. Use the spring initalizer and create a Spring Boot application with `Spring Web`
   dependencies [https://start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io)
2. Add the digiwf-s3-integration dependency

With Maven:

```
   <dependency>
        <groupId>io.muenchendigital.digiwf</groupId>
        <artifactId>digiwf-s3-integration-starter</artifactId>
        <version>${digiwf.version}</version>
   </dependency>
```

With Gradle:

```
implementation group: 'io.muenchendigital.digiwf', name: 'digiwf-s3-integration-starter', version: '${digiwf.version}'
```

3. Configure your S3 bucket with the following properties:
    - `io.muenchendigital.digiwf.s3.bucketName`
    - `io.muenchendigital.digiwf.s3.secretKey`
    - `io.muenchendigital.digiwf.s3.accessKey`
    - `io.muenchendigital.digiwf.s3.url`
    - `io.muenchendigital.digiwf.s3.s3InitialConnectionTest`

`io.muenchendigital.digiwf.s3.s3InitialConnectionTest` is an optional property which allows to enable or disable an initial connection test to the s3 bucket during boot up. 
If the property is `true` or not set, the connection test is performed.
If the property is explicitly set to `false`, no connection test is carried out.

If you want to use the cron job cleanup, take a look at the <a href="#cron-job-cleanup">usage exmaple</a> .

5. OpenAPI specification:

   - Enjoy the [OpenAPI definition](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html?configUrl=/v3/api-docs/swagger-config)
   - Get the [Api-Docs](http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs)

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

### Usage

The library has several functionalities that can be configured. We have provided examples that show how you can use
them.

_For more examples, please refer to the [example-s3-integration](https://github.com/it-at-m/digiwf-s3-integration/tree/dev/example-s3-integration)
folder_

### Minimum necessary spring boot annotations

Listed below are the required Spring boot annotations, which are minimal.

* ```@SpringBootApplication```
* ```@EnableJpaAuditing```
* ```@EnableScheduling```

### Cron Job Cleanup

Files need to be deleted after some time. We have developed a file structure to which an end of life timestamp can be saved. 
The cron job setting determines how often and when the files are checked and deleted. To use this functionality
configure the property:

``io.muenchendigital.digiwf.s3.cronjob.cleanup.expired-files=0 15 10 15 * ?``

This job cleans the metadata of the S3 files in the database if no corresponding file within the S3 storage exists.

``io.muenchendigital.digiwf.s3.cronjob.cleanup.unused-files=0 15 10 16 * ?``

## Getting the integration client library

_Below is an example of how you can installing and setup up your service_

1. Use the spring initalizer and create a Spring Boot application with `Spring Web`
   dependencies [https://start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io)
2. Add the digiwf-s3-integration dependency

With Maven:

```
   <dependency>
        <groupId>io.muenchendigital.digiwf</groupId>
        <artifactId>digiwf-s3-integration-client-starter</artifactId>
        <version>${digiwf.version}</version>
   </dependency>
```

With Gradle:

```
implementation group: 'io.muenchendigital.digiwf', name: 'digiwf-s3-integration-client-starter', version: '${digiwf.version}'
```

3. Configure your service which uses this starter with the following properties:
   - `io.muenchendigital.digiwf.s3.client.document-storage-url`

### Usage

The client library provides several beans that can be used to interact with the `digiwf-s3-integration-starter`. We have provided examples that show how you can use
them.

_For more examples, please refer to the [example-s3-integration-client](https://github.com/it-at-m/digiwf-s3-integration/tree/dev/example-s3-integration-client)
folder_
